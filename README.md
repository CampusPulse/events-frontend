# Frontend

This is the UI for our Campus Event feed.

Its purpose is to allow users to read about campus events and pull from our public REST API for events.

### Getting Started with the Campus Pulse Frontend

* Clone this repo
* Ensure the backend API (in the `api` repo) is set up and running
* Run: `npm start`


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
